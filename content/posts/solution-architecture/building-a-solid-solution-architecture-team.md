Solution Architects, sometimes referred to as Sales Engineer or Sales Consultant, are a unique combination of deep technical knowledge and an understanding of how to solve customer problems with solutions based on a deep understanding of that technical knowledge. Solution Architects must have the ability to communicate technical concepts to non-technical and technical audiences alike. It is a role that requires building technical trust with customers and prospects; technical trust that is achieved by providing insightful and trusted technical solutions for companies most challenging technical problems.

## The Challenge
The unique combinations of skills required by a Solution Architect makes it a challenging positions to hire. The best talent is expensive and in high demand. And even when you are able to find experienced talent, it still takes several months for them to ramp up on new products, technologies and your companies sales processes - all while paying top dollar for them to do that. Once these more senior Solution Architects are ramped and having an impact on results it becomes a continuous challenge to retain them. Because there is such a high demand for this role, the most experienced Solution Architects can easily move between companies - this becomes very expensive - recruit, hire, train, a few solid months of impact, then they leave.

Typically when you hire for more senior Solution Architect positions the experienced hire has a mindset that you are lucky to have them since they probably had a lot of other lucrative opportunities. 

A lot of the most experienced Solution Architects may feel like they don't have to learn at the same rate that they did earlier in their career. Customer meetings come first and when they prioritize their schedules, continuous learning is typically the fist thing to go. But continuous learning is critical as technology is changing at an accelerated pace. So you are paying top dollar for experienced professionals that aren't as willing to learn and grow as they once may have been because everyone wants to hire them. This can be somewhat mitigated with a strong sales and technical learning program to include workshops, certifications and other continuous learning. But it is still a struggle to pull senior Solution Architects away from direct revenue generating activities for continuous learning activities.

## What to do about it?
Rather than hire more experienced (and more expensive) Solution Architects, hire for potential - even if there is an initial experience gap. But how do you do that? You have to be willing to put the same **effort** and have the same **patience** it takes to do anything well. You have to be willing to settle for less experience and instead hire based on measuring a candidate's ability to grow into the role and a candidate's desire to continuously build their level of experience.

There is a much larger pool of candidates with little or no Solution Architecture experience but who have the technical aptitude to become excellent Solution Architects. So hiring cycles should be shorter and less expensive. 

A good source of the right kind of talent could be technical consultants who wants less travel or a recent college graduates with technical degrees who want to work with people and not just write code all day.

### Hire to Build Talent
Hire less experienced, less expensive Solution Architects that have the capacity and desire to learn quickly and continuously.
You don't have to hire people with Solution Architecture or sales experience. You do need to hire people that have a deep understanding of technology and the ability to understand how technical solutions solve real business problems. And most importantly, have the potential to communicate complex technical solutions to customers.

Less experienced candidates that are offered a Solution Architect position are excited about being given the opportunity. This excitement is infectious, in a good way, and raises the morale of the whole team. It instils a willingness to work together and to help each other that will pay big dividends as they are promoted and move on to other more experienced Solution Architect teams. 

This also provides an opportunity to instill values that will stick with these Solution Architects as they are promoted within your organization - and perhaps even rubbing off on more senior hires.

### Provide Clear Responsibilities
People want to know what is expected of them, especially when embarking upon a new career path. This is no different for a Solution Architect. As a leader of less experienced Solution Architects it is critical that you provide a clear list of expectations and constantly review and revisit these expectations with regular one on ones.

IDEAS - where do these candidates come from - technical consulting, college graduates with technical degrees, internally from customer success and support.

### Provide Clear and Concise Goals
Short term - base a variable component of their pay on Monthly Business Objectives (MBOs) and define those MBOs to meet the larger goals of the team while at the same time preparing them for the next level by aligning smaller personal goals with the necessary experience to be a more senior Solution Architect.

Long term goals are also important and shouldn't be as broad as just "sell more".

### Provide a Clear Career Path
People don't typically want to take a new job that they believe is a dead end. There has to be a level of openness and willingness to provide career paths that is clear and attainable - and not open ended and uncertain. You must also make it clear that a career path is not limited to promotions as a Solution Architect.

### Motivate Them to Over Achieve
Motivation goes a long way when people are hungry to succeed and not complacent with their level or role. And over achieving does not necessarily mean working longer or harder, but working smarter and being focused in the day to day execution of the responsibilities, goals and long term objectives that are clearly defined for them.

### Promote Them When They Are Ready
You can't wait and promote when you are ready or when there is exactly the right spot opens up. You have to promote them when they are ready. If you don't they won't want to stay.
Always push them to achieve at the next level.
Also, by promoting when they are ready, you will motivate others on the team and help attract new talent.

### Be Willing to Fail
I firmly believe that this approach of hiring for potential and building strong Solution Architects will succeed more than it will fail. But you have to be willing and realistic that not all of these types of hires will turn out as you would like.

## A Supplemental Approach

Building a strong foundation by building vs buying experience is not meant to completely replace more traditional approaches to hiring Solution Architects. There will be times where you need the right level of experience as soon as possible for more immediate business impact. So the approaches aren't mutually exclusive of each other. But if you stick with the approach of building experience, then after a year or two you will have a pipeline of highly skilled Solution Architects and minimize the expense of recruiting, hiring and training more experienced and expensive talent.
