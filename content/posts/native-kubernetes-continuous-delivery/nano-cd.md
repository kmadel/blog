## Portlets to Microservices

As a Java developer I spent a number of years writing Portlets - JSR-168 anyone?

Eventually moved on to microservice architecture in 2013 and led a team of engineers whose job it was to provide an enterprise framework for the development of microservice applications/APIs. 

REST, Spring, embedded Jetty - Jersey - JAX-RS anyone?

Containerization. I suppose you could put a Weblogic app server in a contaienr and still run portlets - sounds fun doesn't it.

## Containers

As a Java developer in the first decade of the 21st century I was not typically concerned with infrastructure or operations. I wrote some code for a new application or feature, checked it into source control and moved on to my next coding task. Containers changed that.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes has greatly accelerated the ability to adopt new application architectures that provide faster delivery.

## What is Nano CD?
It is smaller, faster, harder - so how do you do it?

Gloo or Istion

API Gateway vs service mesh?

Knative Server
