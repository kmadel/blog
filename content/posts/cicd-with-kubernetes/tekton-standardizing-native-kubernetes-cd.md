Perhaps the most exciting project that was announced as one of the four initial Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) projects is Tekton. It is also the newest of the four. Surrounded by industry stalwarts with Jenkins on one side and Spinnaker the other - and then there is the upstart Jenkins X that is only a year old, but seems much older in tech years compared to Tekton.

## Where did Tekton come from?
Tekton lives on GitHub as do so many important open source projects. The [tektoncd GitHub Organization](https://github.com/tektoncd) didn't even exist a week ago and its website at tekton.dev was still under construction - that's how new Tekton is. Before last week, Tekton lived in the ***build-pipeline*** repository under the [knative GitHub Organization](https://github.com/knative).

## Why is Tekton important?
