The importance of CI/CD has rapidly accelerated over the last several years.

Ok, so Jenkins isn't dead - that was just an attention grabbing title. But Jenkins is becoming *legacy* and in the world of sotware development, that is about the same thing as dead. Before I explain, let me tell you what I mean by *legacy*. Legacy means you are using a tool or processes because you feel like it is too difficult to swtich to what you know is a better tool or process.

In the area of application servers the better tool/process 

Alright, so Jenkins isn't exactly dead but it is headed in the direction of other once more relevant technologies that although may still be used by many, many that work in the DevOps space find ourselves cringing when they are mentioned. 

Technologies like Jenkins never actually die but rather end up on perpetual life support. Part of the issue is how slow many organizations are - for example taking 3 years or more for a large enterprise to migrate to a new source control and that source control is already considered old by the fast movers.

Containers came on the scene, with the help of Docker - ephemeral agents.

Then Kubernetes - and a project as large as Kubernetes forced rapid development of new ways to do CI/CD. The desire to leverage Kubernetes itself for the workload to build and test Kubnernetes
