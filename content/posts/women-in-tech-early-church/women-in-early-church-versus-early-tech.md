Women were a very important part of the early Christian church just as they have been to the rise of a technical society. information age.


Similar to the way that the Church downplayed the role of women in the early Church, society has done the same thing about women's roles in regards to the evolution of information technology.

Women developed the new field of computer programming during World War II.


As positions in the early Christian Church became prominent positions of power in society women were not only forced out, but the history of their importance in the early Church was rewritten by the men that were taking control of the early Christian Church. A similar evolution has occurred in regards to computer programming. The early history of computer programming was dominated by women - the first programmers were women, the first modern programming language was created by a woman - but as computer programing and information technology took on a more important place in modern society women were pushed aside by men.
