  title: "Incoherent Thoughts of a Young Marine"
  description: "This series will share a number of my diary entries, in no particular order, that I wrote while serving in the Marine Corps from January 1991 until my honorable discharge in November of 1994. The title of the series is meant to be somewhat self-demeaning and funny - but some of my thoughts might be considered coherent and, perhaps, even interesting. For the most part, each entry is very short and unedited from the original entry. They may make you laugh or think or get pissed off or who knows. Enjoy!"
